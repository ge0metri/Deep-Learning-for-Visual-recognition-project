creating a base model
- creating an image loader
-- file or link (?) -> image
-- image -> preprocessed image
- initial training of the deep encoder 

creating the ss model
- training a new decoder
- updating the encoder 
- get new images from the web and process those
- creating the image permuter
- 

testing
- training the new decoder
- heatmap
- loss/accuracy curves


report
- address overfitting

========================

Add model_tools.py
- has layers
- has loss
- has metric
- has
